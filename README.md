Lexer Details:

Recognizes tokens such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, data types, keywords, etc.
Ignores whitespace, comments, and unrecognized characters.
Provides actions like printing token information and storing values.
Uses yywrap function to indicate end of input.

Yacc File Details:

Includes headers like <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>.
Defines external functions like yyerror and variables like yyin.
Uses union for holding string or integer values.
Defines tokens, start symbol, grammar rules, and main function.

Grammar Rules:

Includes rules for program structure, variable declarations, functions, statements, expressions, etc.
Supports int and char data types.
Handles compound statements, assignments, function calls, and more.

Main Function:

Handles program startup, file I/O, and parsing.
Opens input, lexer output, and parser output files.
Calls yyparse() for parsing and closes files afterward.
Overall Functionality:

This C program serves as a parser for a mini-C language.
Interacts with a lexer to obtain tokens and uses Yacc for defining grammar rules.
Analyzes token stream to verify adherence to defined grammar.
